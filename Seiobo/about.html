                                <h3 class="question">What’s on the menu?</h3>
                                <p class="answer">Seiōbo serves a tasting menu that will take you to places like Barbados, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Cuba. We like to keep things fluid and fun, which means you won’t get a menu when you arrive. If you have dietary requirements, we are happy to accommodate, we just ask for a head’s up as our kitchen will need to design a menu especially for you.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="question-container">
                                <h3 class="question">Is there a difference between the early and later seating menu? Why are they different prices?</h3>
                                <p class="answer">We serve the same tasting menu for both seatings. Due to the time limit to accommodate the second seating, we have reflected this in the price of the menu at 5:45 pm.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="question-container">
                                <h3 class="question">Is bar food available?</h3>
                                <p class="answer">Unfortunately, bar food is not available. Seiōbo currently serves a tasting menu only. Seating times are 5:45pm and 8:30pm. Reservations are essential and can be made <a class="faq-link" id="faq-reserve-link"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

                                <p class="answer">Yes. We will do our best to accommodate food allergies and dietary requirements. When making a reservation, please add your food allergies / restrictions to your reservation notes.

                                <h3 class="question">Can I bring my kids? Is there a kid’s menu?</h3>
                                <p class="answer">Due to social distancing and capacity restrictions, we have a limited number of seats in the restaurant. Therefore, we only have the tasting menu available. If your kids would like to dine on the tasting menu, they are more than welcome to join us. Unfortunately, we do not have a separate kid’s menu and each person booked will be charged the full tasting menu price.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="question-container">
                                <h3 class="question">Do you have a pre-theatre menu? Can I do the tasting menu and be out in time for a 7:30pm show?</h3>
                                <p class="answer">Our tasting menu normally takes 2-2.5 hours to complete so we cannot guarantee you would be able to get out in time for the 7:30pm show. We only offer the 7-course menu and do not have any other pre-theatre options.<br>
                                    We have had some guests complete the menu in a shorter amount of time. However, this is largely dependent on the individual guests’ pacing.  If you would like to go ahead and make a booking in our 5:45pm seating, please make a note that you will need to be out by 7:25pm in order to be on time for the show (the Lyric Theatre is less than a 5 minute walk from the restaurant). We kindly request that you are on time for the booking, and please be mindful that we can cook and serve you only as quickly as you can eat.<br>                       
                                    Due to the limitations on capacity and to reduce risk between seating times due to Covid, we are unable to offer for you to come back for dessert after the show. If you are unable to get through the meal in time for the show, we are happy to pack up any desserts for you to have during the intermission or to take home for later.</p>

                                <p class="answer">Yes. We take reservations through our site. There are two seatings each night – 5:45pm and 8:30pm.<br>
                                    Due to the limited size and capacity of the restaurant, we will only accept walk-ins in the case of a cancellation or if there is availability.</p>

                                <p class="answer">A cancellation fee of $200pp will be charged to your card in the case of cancellation with less than 24 hours’ notice and for no-shows.</p>
